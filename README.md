#basically what I did was use the example as reference in order to complete this assignment. 
#I created two lists for the rng psudo code to pull from. I named the user_response_good and user_response_bad.
#if the user inputs "good", then the code will pull from the list of user_response_good and will print that text.
#if the user inputs "bad", then the code will pull from the list of user_response_bad and will print that text.
#if the user inputs an unknown word, then the code will print the reponse that I provided.
#finaly when the user inputs "done", then the code ends. Otherwise the code will continue to request for and input from the user.
